     * Argon2 is the winner of the PHC (Password Hashing Competition) and provides a tunable memory
     * hard password hash. It has a standard string encoding, which looks like:
     *
     * "$argon2id$v=19$m=262144,t=1,p=1$8r5BhdM07OhW6KWZrxenSw$l6+i7J1g5XOzw/tqQVZzb1LMH1QzrWQRLlB+72kO4JA".
     *
     * Argon2 has three tunable parameters: \a memory, \a parallelization, and \a iterations.
     * \a memory gives the total memory consumption of the algorithm in kilobytes. Increasing
     * \a parallelization increases the available parallelism of the computation. The
     * \a iterations parameter gives the number of passes which are made over the data.
     *
     * There are three variants of Argon2, namely Argon2d, Argon2i and Argon2id. Argon2d uses data
     * dependent table lookups with may leak information about the password via side channel
     * attacks, and is not recommended for password hashing. Argon2i uses data independent table
     * lookups and is immune to these attacks, but at the cost of requiring higher \a iterations
     * for security. Argon2id uses a hybrid approach which is thought to be highly secure. The
     * algorithm designers recommend using Argon2id with \a iterations and \a parallelization
     * both equal to \c 1 and \a memory set to the largest amount of memory usable in your

     * Returns a password hash using the Bcrypt algorithm with the given \a workFactor and
     * \a version.
     *
     * Bcrypt is a password hashing scheme originally designed for use in OpenBSD, but numerous
     * other implementations exist.
     *
     * It has the advantage that it requires a small amount (4K) of fast RAM to compute, which
     * can make hardware password cracking somewhat more expensive.
     *
     * Bcrypt provides outputs that look like this:
     *
     * "$2a$12$7KIYdyv8Bp32WAvc.7YvI.wvRlyVn0HP/EhPmmOyMQA4YKxINO0p2"
     *
     * \note Due to the design of bcrypt, the password is effectively truncated at 72 characters;
     * further characters are ignored and do not change the hash. To support longer passwords, one
     * common approach is to pre-hash the password with SHA-256, then run bcrypt using the hex
     * or base64 encoding of the hash as the password. (Many bcrypt implementations truncate the
     * password at the first NULL character, so hashing the raw binary SHA-256 may cause problems.
     * Botanâ€™s bcrypt implementation will hash whatever values are given in the \a password
     * including any embedded NULLs so this is not an issue, but might cause interop problems if
     * another library needs to validate the password hashes.)
     *
     * Higher \a workFactor increase the amount of time the algorithm runs, increasing the cost of
     * cracking attempts. The increase is exponential, so a \a workFactor of 12 takes roughly twice
     * as long as \a workFactor 11.
     *
     * It is recommended to set the \a workFactor as high as your system can tolerate (from a
     * performance and latency perspective) since higher \a workFactors greatly improve the
     * security against GPU-based attacks. For example, for protecting high value administrator
     * passwords, consider using \a workFactor 15 or 16; at these \a workFactors each bcrypt
     * computation takes several seconds. Since admin logins will be relatively uncommon, it
     * might be acceptable for each login attempt to take some time. As of 2018, a good password
     * cracking rig (with 8 NVIDIA 1080 cards) can attempt about 1 billion bcrypt computations
     * per month for \a workFactor 13. For \a workFactor 12, it can do twice as many. For
     * \a workFactor 15, it can do only one quarter as many attempts.
     *
     * \note Due to bugs affecting various implementations of bcrypt, several different variants
     * of the algorithm are defined. As of 2.7.0 Botan supports generating (or checking) the
     * 2a, 2b, and 2y variants. Since Botan has never been affected by any of the bugs which
     * necessitated these version upgrades, all three versions are identical beyond the \a version
     * identifier. Which variant to use is controlled by the \a version argument.
     *
     * The bcrypt \a workFactor must be at least 4 (though at this \a workFactor bcrypt is not
     * very secure). The bcrypt format allows up to 31, but Botan currently rejects all
     * \a workFactors greater than 18 since even that \a workFactor requires roughly 15 seconds
     * of computation on a fast machine.
     *

     * @param workFactor    The work factor used for computation, between 4 and 18.
